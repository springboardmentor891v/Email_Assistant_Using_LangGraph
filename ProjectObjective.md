## Project Objectives

### 1. Proactive Triage

Design an intelligent triage mechanism that automatically classifies incoming emails into ignore, notify human, or respond, enabling proactive email management without explicit user prompts.

### 2. Persistent Memory

Implement stateful and long-term memory to store user preferences, feedback, and historical interactions, allowing the assistant to learn continuously and improve decision-making over time.

### 3. True Autonomy via Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

Achieve safe autonomy by allowing the agent to independently perform low-risk actions while pausing for human approval before executing high-risk operations such as sending emails or modifying calendars.

### 4. Robustness via Evaluation

Ensure system reliability by evaluating triage accuracy and response quality using curated test datasets and LLM-based evaluation techniques, supported by observability and tracing through LangSmith.

### 5. Real-World Deployment

Deploy the assistant in a real-world environment by integrating it with the Gmail API, enabling it to read, manage, and respond to live emails from an actual inbox.

### 6. Developing a User Interface

Develop an intuitive user interface that allows users to review emails, approve or edit agent actions, and interact seamlessly with the system during Human-in-the-Loop checkpoints.
