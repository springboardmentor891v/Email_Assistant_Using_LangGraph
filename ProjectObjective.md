# Assignment 1 – Short Definitions

## 1. Proactive Triage
Proactive triage is the capability of an intelligent agent to analyze and categorize incoming data **before** a user explicitly interacts with it. Instead of waiting for instructions, the agent evaluates incoming information (such as emails) and decides whether it should be ignored, flagged for human review, or acted upon. This helps reduce manual effort and ensures important items receive timely attention.

## 2. Persistent Memory
Persistent memory allows an AI agent to retain and recall information across multiple interactions. This includes user preferences, prior decisions, corrections, and feedback. By leveraging stored memory, the agent becomes adaptive and context-aware, eliminating the need to relearn information for every new task and improving consistency over time.

## 3. True Autonomy via Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
True autonomy via Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) is a design principle where the agent autonomously handles low-risk tasks while seeking human approval for high-risk or critical actions. In this approach, humans act as a safety mechanism who can approve, reject, or modify the agent’s decisions, ensuring reliability and trust in automated systems.

## 4. Robustness via Evaluation
Robustness via evaluation ensures that the agent operates reliably under varying conditions. This involves testing the agent using predefined datasets, measuring accuracy, and evaluating response quality using techniques such as *LLM-as-a-judge*. Continuous evaluation helps identify weaknesses, improve decision-making, and maintain consistent system performance.

## 5. Real-World Deployment
Real-world deployment refers to transitioning an AI agent from a prototype to a live production environment. This process includes integrating with real services such as email or calendar APIs, securely handling user data, and ensuring the system performs safely and effectively in practical, real-world scenarios.

## 6. Developing a User Interface
Developing a user interface (UI) involves creating an interactive layer through which users can engage with the agent. The UI enables users to review agent decisions, approve or edit actions, receive notifications, and understand the agent’s behavior. A well-designed UI improves usability, transparency, and overall user experience.
