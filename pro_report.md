# Project Title

## 1. Proactive Triage
Proactive triage means the system can identify issues or priorities before the user explicitly asks.  
In our project, this is achieved by analyzing inputs and predicting user needs.  
This improves response time and user satisfaction.

## 2. Persistent Memory
Persistent memory allows the system to remember important user information across sessions.  
This helps in personalization and continuity.  
For example, the system remembers user preferences and past interactions.

## 3. True Autonomy via Human in the Loop
The system can act autonomously but still allows human intervention when required.  
This ensures safety, accuracy, and ethical control.  
Humans can review, correct, or approve decisions.

## 4. Robustness via Evaluation
Robustness is achieved by continuously evaluating system performance.  
Regular testing ensures reliability under different conditions.  
Metrics like accuracy, latency, and failure rate are monitored.

## 5. Real-World Deployment
This phase focuses on deploying the system in real environments.  
It includes hosting, monitoring, and handling real user data.  
The system must be scalable and secure.

## 6. Developing a User Interface
A user-friendly interface is designed for easy interaction.  
It includes forms, buttons, and visual feedback.  
The goal is simplicity, clarity, and accessibility.
