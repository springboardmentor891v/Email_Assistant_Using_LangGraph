# Email_Assistant_Using_LangGraph
The primary objective of this project is to design, build, and deploy a next-generation, autonomous email assistant using LangGraph. This project moves beyond a simple reactive agent. The goal is to create a sophisticated, "ambient" agent that proactively manages email workflow.
